    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;

    console.log(age, age2);

    age = 200

    // etc.. etc...



    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    const team = players;

    console.log(team, players);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    team[3] = "dev";

    console.log(team);
    console.log(players);

    // however what happens when we update that array?



    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!



    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    const team2 = players.slice();
    console.log(team2);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    const team4 = [].concat(players);
    console.log(team4);
    
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    
    const team3 = [...players];
    console.log(team3);

    // or....

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    console.log(team5);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    const captain = person;

    captain.age = 99;

    console.log(person);

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 60});

    console.log(captain2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // const captainSpread = {...captain2};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const devin = {
      name : "Devin",
      age : 99,
      social: {
        twitter: "@devinegger",
        facebook: "devinegger"
      }
    }
